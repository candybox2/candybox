<h2>There will be a sequel :)</h2>
    
At first I didn't want to make a sequel - but I didn't expect there would be so much people to play & enjoy the game.
That's why I'll make one. Here's a recap of what <i>should</i> be present in this sequel, partly based on the suggestions some of you sent by email.

  - ascii art
  - quests & weapons
  - more easter eggs
  - an automatic saving feature - every 10 minutes, for example
  - keyboard shortcuts
  - a downloadable, offline version for those who don't have a reliable internet connection
  - a better authentification system (with user/password, probably)
  - both global and personal statistics
  - compatibility with low resolutions & smartphones
  - squirrels !!

And also :
  
  - the concept of "nothing at first, and then the game grows more and more" will be kept
  - you won't have to pay anything to play, or whatever
  - the player will have more choices to do, a bit like in a RPG
  - the code will be cleaner ;)
  - the python server will soon be on a public repository
  - the javascript client will be on a public repository when the game will be released
  - both the server and the client WILL be <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">free software</a> - free as in "freedom"
  
  
No, the sequel won't come very soon ! The current version has just been released, so I need some time to make it. But it will be worth it ;)
<b>Update : the sequel will probably be released around October !</b>
